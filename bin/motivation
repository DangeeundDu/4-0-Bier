echo """You can do it!!
Any exploit is a journey.
10% of life is what happens to you and 90% is how you pwn this service now!!! :>
The future holds all the exploits.
Don't meltdown, you will find it if you look for it!!
I suspectre that you are very close!!!
Failure leads to exploits. Exploits lead to FLAGS AND POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It doesn't matter how slow you bruteforce, as long as you never stop.
If you can dream it, you can exploit it!
If you're going through hell, keep going!!
Quality is not an act, it is the goal of software engineering obtained by a well defined process. And these services certainly did not go through one.
Aim for the moon. If you miss you might get shot down by a defense missile. Hopefully it has bugs.
You've already come so far!""" | shuf --random-source=/dev/urandom | head -n1
